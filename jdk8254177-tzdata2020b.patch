+# From Milamber (2020-05-31)
+# In Morocco (where I live), the end of Ramadan (Arabic month) is followed by
+# the Eid al-Fitr, and concretely it's 1 or 2 day offs for the people (with
+# traditional visiting of family, big lunches/dinners, etc.).  So for this
+# year the astronomical calculations don't include the following 2 days off in
+# the calc.  These 2 days fall in a Sunday/Monday, so it's not acceptable by
+# people to have a time shift during these 2 days off.  Perhaps you can modify
+# the (predicted) rules for next years: if the end of Ramadan is a (probable)
+# Friday or Saturday (and so the 2 days off are on a weekend), the next time
+# shift will be the next weekend.
+#
+# From Paul Eggert (2020-05-31):
 # For now, guess that in the future Morocco will fall back at 03:00
 # the last Sunday before Ramadan, and spring forward at 02:00 the
-# first Sunday after the day after Ramadan.  To implement this,
-# transition dates for 2021 through 2087 were determined by running

+# the law of 1891 <https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k64415343.texteImage>
+# was published on 1891-03-15, so it could only take force on 1891-03-16.
+
+# From Michael Deckers (2020-06-10):
+# Le Gaulois, 1911-03-11, page 1/6, online at
+# https://www.retronews.fr/societe/echo-de-presse/2018/01/29/1911-change-lheure-de-paris
+# ... [ Instantly, all pressure driven clock dials halted...  Nine minutes and
+#       twenty-one seconds later the hands resumed their circular motion. ]
+# There are also precise reports about how the change was prepared in train
+# stations: all the publicly visible clocks stopped at midnight railway time
+# (or were covered), only the chief of service had a watch, labeled
+# "Heure ancienne", that he kept running until it reached 00:04:21, when
+# he announced "Heure nouvelle".  See the "Le Petit Journal 1911-03-11".
+# https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6192911/f1.item.zoom
+#
+# From Michael Deckers (2020-06-12):
+# That "all French clocks stopped" for 00:09:21 is a misreading of French
+# newspapers; this sort of adjustment applies only to certain
+# remote-controlled clocks ("pendules pneumatiques", of which there existed
+# perhaps a dozen in Paris, and which simply could not be set back remotely),
+# but not to all the clocks in all French towns and villages.  For instance,
+# the following story in the "Courrier de Saône-et-Loire" 1911-03-11, page 2:
+# only works if legal time was stepped back (was not monotone): ...
+#   [One can observe that children who had been born at midnight less 5
+#    minutes and who had died at midnight of the old time, would turn out to
+#    be dead before being born, time having been set back and having
+#    suppressed 9 minutes and 25 seconds of their existence, that is, more
+#    than they could spend.]
+#
+# From Paul Eggert (2020-06-12):
+# French time in railway stations was legally five minutes behind civil time,
+# which explains why railway "old time" ran to 00:04:21 instead of to 00:09:21.
+# The law's text (which Michael Deckers noted is at
+# <https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2022333z/f2>) says only that
+# at 1911-03-11 00:00 legal time was that of Paris mean time delayed by
+# nine minutes and twenty-one seconds, and does not say how the
+# transition from Paris mean time was to occur.
+#
+# tzdb has no way to represent stopped clocks.  As the railway practice
+# was to keep a watch running on "old time" to decide when to restart
+# the other clocks, this could be modeled as a transition for "old time" at
+# 00:09:21.  However, since the law was ambiguous and clocks outside railway
+# stations were probably done haphazardly with the popular impression being
+# that the transition was done at 00:00 "old time", simply leave the time
+# blank; this causes zic to default to 00:00 "old time" which is good enough.
+# Do something similar for the 1891-03-16 transition.  There are similar
+# problems in Algiers, Monaco and Tunis.

+# From Milamber (2020-05-31)
+# In Morocco (where I live), the end of Ramadan (Arabic month) is followed by
+# the Eid al-Fitr, and concretely it's 1 or 2 day offs for the people (with
+# traditional visiting of family, big lunches/dinners, etc.).  So for this
+# year the astronomical calculations don't include the following 2 days off in
+# the calc.  These 2 days fall in a Sunday/Monday, so it's not acceptable by
+# people to have a time shift during these 2 days off.  Perhaps you can modify
+# the (predicted) rules for next years: if the end of Ramadan is a (probable)
+# Friday or Saturday (and so the 2 days off are on a weekend), the next time
+# shift will be the next weekend.
+#
+# From Paul Eggert (2020-05-31):
 # For now, guess that in the future Morocco will fall back at 03:00
 # the last Sunday before Ramadan, and spring forward at 02:00 the
-# first Sunday after the day after Ramadan.  To implement this,
-# transition dates for 2021 through 2087 were determined by running

 # Françoise Gauquelin, Problèmes de l'heure résolus en astrologie,
 # Guy Trédaniel, Paris 1987
 
+# From Michael Deckers (2020-06-11):
+# the law of 1891 <https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k64415343.texteImage>
+# was published on 1891-03-15, so it could only take force on 1891-03-16.
+
+# From Michael Deckers (2020-06-10):
+# Le Gaulois, 1911-03-11, page 1/6, online at
+# https://www.retronews.fr/societe/echo-de-presse/2018/01/29/1911-change-lheure-de-paris
+# ... [ Instantly, all pressure driven clock dials halted...  Nine minutes and
+#       twenty-one seconds later the hands resumed their circular motion. ]
+# There are also precise reports about how the change was prepared in train
+# stations: all the publicly visible clocks stopped at midnight railway time
+# (or were covered), only the chief of service had a watch, labeled
+# "Heure ancienne", that he kept running until it reached 00:04:21, when
+# he announced "Heure nouvelle".  See the "Le Petit Journal 1911-03-11".
+# https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6192911/f1.item.zoom
+#
+# From Michael Deckers (2020-06-12):
+# That "all French clocks stopped" for 00:09:21 is a misreading of French
+# newspapers; this sort of adjustment applies only to certain
+# remote-controlled clocks ("pendules pneumatiques", of which there existed
+# perhaps a dozen in Paris, and which simply could not be set back remotely),
+# but not to all the clocks in all French towns and villages.  For instance,
+# the following story in the "Courrier de Saône-et-Loire" 1911-03-11, page 2:
+# only works if legal time was stepped back (was not monotone): ...
+#   [One can observe that children who had been born at midnight less 5
+#    minutes and who had died at midnight of the old time, would turn out to
+#    be dead before being born, time having been set back and having
+#    suppressed 9 minutes and 25 seconds of their existence, that is, more
+#    than they could spend.]
+#
+# From Paul Eggert (2020-06-12):
+# French time in railway stations was legally five minutes behind civil time,
+# which explains why railway "old time" ran to 00:04:21 instead of to 00:09:21.
+# The law's text (which Michael Deckers noted is at
+# <https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2022333z/f2>) says only that
+# at 1911-03-11 00:00 legal time was that of Paris mean time delayed by
+# nine minutes and twenty-one seconds, and does not say how the
+# transition from Paris mean time was to occur.
+#
+# tzdb has no way to represent stopped clocks.  As the railway practice
+# was to keep a watch running on "old time" to decide when to restart
+# the other clocks, this could be modeled as a transition for "old time" at
+# 00:09:21.  However, since the law was ambiguous and clocks outside railway
+# stations were probably done haphazardly with the popular impression being
+# that the transition was done at 00:00 "old time", simply leave the time
+# blank; this causes zic to default to 00:00 "old time" which is good enough.
+# Do something similar for the 1891-03-16 transition.  There are similar
+# problems in Algiers, Monaco and Tunis.

 # Shank & Pottenger seem to use '24:00' ambiguously; resolve it with Whitman.
